# Description pipeline: 

1. The pipeline generates a photo-realistic image given any text input. 
2. The image generated by the diffusion model is segmented automatically. Two types of segmentation are available: hair segmentation or segmenting the image into the following categories: background, person, cat, dog, and potted plant. The user needs to choose the type of segmentation.
3. Finally, an inpainting diffusion model takes the first generated image, its mask, and a new prompt. The inpainting model replaces the portion of the original image segmented with another image based on a textual prompt.
